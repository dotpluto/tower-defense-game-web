# About Particles
In this game you are dropped on uncharted planets and are tasked with building a base that extracts as much resources as possible as quickly as possible. But don't get too greedy or the ever increasing amount of locals will get to you before you can evacuate with your loot.

## TODO
- introduce some actual enemy spawning
    - enemies spawn from temporary cave exits
    - enemies grow linerarly with buildings
    - linear growth
    - slowly ramping up exponential growth
    - around all buildings
- introduce meta-progression
  - explore different planets
    - planets with different levels of energy
    - planets good for one of the following: constant solar (expensive price, unlimited), varying solar (batteries), limited geothermal (low price, limited)
    - local resources and global resources
- implement planet selection screen using a singleton?
- tower type ideas:
  - money farm (invest for later profit)
  - laser turret (sweeping aoe turret with slow moving laser beam)
  - melee tower (generate damage points which are spent to damage enemies on contact)
  - shotgun tower
- proper error screen
- fancy graphics/ux
  - transition landing screen planet selection -> planet (picture of base entering orbit)
  - sound with limited sounds at once
