# About Particles
This game is about dropping on unexplored planets and trying to extract as much resources as possible as fast as possible while under ever increasing threat from the local fauna. Think extraction shooter mixed with rts.

## TODO
- introduce meta-progression
  - explore different planets
    - planets with different levels of energy
    - planets good for one of the following: constant solar (expensive price, unlimited), varying solar (batteries), limited geothermal (low price, limited)
    - local resources and global resources
- implement planet selection screen using a singleton?
- tower type ideas:
  - money farm (invest for later profit)
  - laser turret (sweeping aoe turret with slow moving laser beam)
  - melee tower (generate damage points which are spent to damage enemies on contact)
  - shotgun tower
- proper error screen
- fancy graphics/ux
  - transition landing screen planet selection -> planet (picture of base entering orbit)
  - sound with limited sounds at once
