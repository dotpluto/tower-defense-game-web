# Particles
Particles is a 2D tower defense game. Your goal is it to defend a newly established colony from the agressive locals.
Decide on the right stratergy to kill them all.
## TODO
- introduce meta-progression
  - explore different planets
    - planets with different levels of energy
    - planets good for one of the following: constant solar (expensive price, unlimited), varying solar (batteries), limited geothermal (low price, limited)
    - local resources and global resources

  
- implement planet selection screen using a singleton?
- tower type ideas:
  - money farm (invest for later profit)
  - laser turret (sweeping aoe turret with slow moving laser beam)
  - melee tower (generate damage points which are spent to damage enemies on contact)
  - shotgun tower
- proper error screen
- fancy graphics/ux
  - transition landing screen planet selection -> planet (picture of base entering orbit)
  - sound with limited sounds at once
